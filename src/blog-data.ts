    content: `In a quiet town tucked between mountains and sea, there was a train station that held an old legend. Every child grew up hearing about the "Train That Never Stopped"—a ghostly locomotive that ran through the town at exactly midnight, never slowing, never picking up passengers.

No one knew where it came from or where it was going. The older folks would shake their heads and say it was just an old tale, something to keep kids from wandering the tracks at night. But those who had seen it swore it was real.

Elliot had always been curious about the legend. As a child, he had pressed his face against his bedroom window, staring at the tracks in the dark, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious train. But he never saw anything—just the empty rails stretching into the distance.

Years passed, and life took Elliot away from his small town. He moved to the city, built a career, and rarely thought of the stories from his childhood. But one night, after receiving news that his mother had fallen ill, he found himself on a train heading back home.

It was a slow, quiet ride. The train weaved through the mountains, its windows reflecting the moonlight. Elliot sat alone in his compartment, lost in thought, watching the familiar countryside roll by.

Then, at exactly midnight, the lights flickered.

The train shuddered, as if something immense had passed by at incredible speed. Elliot pressed his forehead to the window, heart pounding. Through the darkness, he saw it—a silver locomotive racing alongside his train, its wheels gliding over the tracks without a sound.

For a moment, he could see inside. The windows were filled with people—dressed in old-fashioned clothes, their faces blurred like an out-of-focus photograph. Some were reading newspapers from another century, others stared straight ahead, unblinking. At the very front of the train stood a conductor in a deep blue uniform, his cap pulled low over his face.

Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the train was gone.

Elliot sat back in his seat, his hands clammy. Had he imagined it? Was it just a trick of the night? He glanced around the compartment, but no one else seemed to have noticed.

When he arrived at his hometown, he found the station just as he remembered it—small, quiet, and wrapped in mist. His mother’s house was only a short walk away, and he took his time, his mind still on what he had seen.

The next morning, after visiting his mother at the hospital, he stopped by the local library. He had to know more.

Digging through old newspapers, he found an article dated nearly a hundred years ago. It told the story of a tragic accident—how, on a stormy night, a train had lost control on the mountain tracks and derailed, killing everyone on board. The conductor, who had been new to the route, had tried to slow the train but failed. His name was listed at the bottom of the article.

Elliot’s blood ran cold.

It was the same name embroidered on the conductor’s uniform he had seen the night before.

The legend was true. The train had never stopped—not then, not now. It was still running, forever bound to its midnight route, carrying lost souls to a destination unknown.

And for the first time in his life, Elliot understood why the old folks warned children to stay away from the tracks at night.

Because sometimes, the train took passengers.

And it never let them go.
